# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose

A prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm and we will then use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

We use the following methods for the analysis:

- Preprocessing the database,
- Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- Visualizing classification results with scatter plots.
